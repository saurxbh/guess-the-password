# guess-the-password
The player must guess a seven-letter word used as the password. The computerâ€™s memory banks display the possible words, and the player is given hints as to how close each guess was. For example, if the secret password is MONITOR but the player guessed CONTAIN, they are given the hint that two out of seven letters were correctly placed, because both MONITOR and CONTAIN have the letter O and N as their second and third letter.
